## Buffer Todo:

 - setup a pointer to a volatile integer for the number of chairs
 - update sit for manipulating the common chair structure (protected) and mark the position with its id.
 - create a common var for the number of players that have been seated for synchronoization
 - handle what happens to the last player still trying for a seat
